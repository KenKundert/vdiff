As a Package
------------

You can also use vdiff in your own Python programs. To do so, you would do 
something like the following::

    from inform import Error
    from vdiff import Vdiff

    vdiff = Vdiff(lfile="...", rfile="...", useGUI=True)

    try:
        vdiff.edit()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        vdiff.cleanup()
    except Error as err:
        err.report()


Installation
------------

Runs only on Unix systems.  Requires Python 3.5 or later.
Install by running './install' or 'pip3 install vdiff'.
